# ProgDA_Project

For this project I am creating a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon. I am picking Type 1 Diabetes as the dataset. Based on this  phenomenon, the  model has been created and synthesise such data using Python.  We are using  the numpy.random package for this purpose.
* Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
* Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
* Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
* Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook â€“ the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

# Data Preparation
For this project I am using the Type 1 Diabetes data and build my own data set from it.
# Objective
Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin. Insulin is a hormone needed to allow sugar (glucose) to enter cells to produce energy.  Treatment focuses on managing blood sugar levels with insulin, diet and lifestyle to prevent complications.   By analysing the variable available of this are Blood Glucose level, Time of blood test, Carbs intake and Insulin dose.  The Blood Glucose level varies on different time of the day, Carbs intake and insulin dose level varies throughout the day.
