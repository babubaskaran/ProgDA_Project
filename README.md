# ProgDA_Project

For this project I am creating a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon. I am picking Type 1 Diabetes as the dataset. Based on this  phenomenon, the  model has been created and synthesise such data using Python.  We are using  the numpy.random package for this purpose.
* Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
* Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
* Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
* Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook â€“ the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

# Data Preparation
For this project I am using the Type 1 Diabetes data and build my own data set from it.
# Objective
Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin. Insulin is a hormone needed to allow sugar (glucose) to enter cells to produce energy.  Treatment focuses on managing blood sugar levels with insulin, diet and lifestyle to prevent complications.   By analysing the variable available of this are Blood Glucose level, Time of blood test, Carbs intake and Insulin dose.  The Blood Glucose level varies on different time of the day, Carbs intake and insulin dose level varies throughout the day.

So let us use the below 7 different variables for our analysis.

* Date
* Time
* Day of the Week
* Blood Glucose
* Carb Intake
* Insulin Units
* BG Level

The Data that we will create with an algorithm, is based on the real life scenario of Type 1 Diabetes.

For this project I have taken the Type 1 Diabetes log for 49 days from  01/09/2019 to 19/10/2019. Blood Glucose level has recorded on average 4 time a day for 49 days.

# Data Cleanup

Activities for data cleanup also considered, creating different data sets using them to make one data frame.  The values has been used for analysis.  The data indexed for easy retrivel.  

# Distributions

# Data Relationships

* Comparison between Carbs eaten and Blood Glucose level
* Time and Blood Glucose level
* The main variable is Blood Glucose level both Hight & Lows.  This is varies for variable reasons time of the day, the person growth (day by day), food eaten 2 hours before the blood test.  The Blood Glucose tested on morning as fast on week days and weekends varies on time.  If the kid is very small its hard to control whats to eat and whats not to eat.  

* The blood glucose level goes high for the following reasons.

1) The Insulin didnt delivered properly to the body
2) The Insulin dose is low for the carbs eaten
3) Carb count is not correct
4) If the Kid is sicke

* The blood Glucose level goes low for the following reasons.

1) High Insulin delivered
2) Food not eaten for the carb entered
3) If the Kid is playing and active 

The week day blood glucose level stay stable compare to weekends, this is due to the fact the waking up time on weekends and eating breakfast is differs.
